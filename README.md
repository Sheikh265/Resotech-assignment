# Resotech Task Management System - Submission

Dear Resotech Team,

I am pleased to submit my assignment for the Resotech Task Management System. The project involves building a Spring Boot backend application that facilitates CRUD operations for task management.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment aimed to create a robust RESTful API for managing tasks, each having attributes such as Task ID, Task Name, Task Description, Task Status, and Task Due Date.

## Task Requirements

1. **Create a Task:** I have implemented an endpoint to create a new task with the specified attributes.

2. **Read Tasks:** The API includes endpoints to retrieve a list of all tasks and details of a specific task based on its ID.

3. **Update Task:** An endpoint has been implemented to update the details of a specific task.

4. **Delete Task:** The API supports an endpoint to delete a specific task.

5. **Validation:** Input validation has been implemented to ensure that task details adhere to specific criteria, such as non-empty task names and valid due dates.

6. **Documentation:** I have provided clear and concise documentation for the API, including details on how to use each endpoint.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- Java
- Maven for dependency management
